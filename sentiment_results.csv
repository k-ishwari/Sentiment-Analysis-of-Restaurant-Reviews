Worth the trip to Marco,Jun 2024 • Family,I ordered the Doreen’s Salad and it may have been the best salad I have ever had in my life. The blackened chicken was amazing. The garlic knots were mouth watering. We loved every meal we had there. We are back home and now I am craving this place. We were on the island 7 days and ate here 4 times. The only reason we didn’t go every day was because my daughter was embarrassed to go so much….,63 contributions,0.886,0.141,0.829,0.03,Positive,Jun 2024,Family
Average and Pricey,Jun 2024 • Family,"We ordered a Philly cheesesteak Stromboli, salad, and a large pizza. The Stromboli was huge and very good. I thought the pizza was below average.

They are price gouge the tourists. My family’s been coming here since 1950 and this makes me really angry. On top of it, the penne alla vodka was bland and overall disappointing.

A must do for our family,Feb 2024 • Family,"We walk here from South Seas Towers, so that’s always a winner, but this place always nails it in terms of truly thin crust pizza with great options, a family style salad with garlic knots (wow), meatballs, great service and wines and….ok, we love it and consider it one of the best casual Italian spots in the country.",82 contributions,0.9877,0.391,0.609,0.0,Positive,Feb 2024,Family

Large quantities of terrible food,Dec 2023 • Family,"A busy family spot, with mediocre food they claim (incorrectly) is Italian. This place seems to be a clone of Vinny Testa's, a now-defunct Boston eatery famed for serving gargantuan quantities of terrible food. The white pizza we ordered had to be the worst pizza I've ever had. Kids pizza tasted like cardboard. Those who ordered pastas were happier, although the oversauced dishes looked unappetizing and somebody who ordered chicken later complained of a stomache ache. Only saving grace is the service was brisk and they have large tables for big groups. Ceasar salad was passable, barely. Avoid if possible.",,-0.6258,0.092,0.779,0.129,Negative,Dec 2023,Family

Enjoyed the pizza at Joey's,Oct 2023 • Couples,"Had the soup but was not hot and the waitress quickly attended to it. The pizza was delicious and they made it to our specs. We like cheese on top.

Great Italian restaurant,Sept 2023 • Couples,We had the Sicilian style pizza. 2” breaded crust. The large is Huge!!! The crust is very light and it us a lot if bread- so if that’s not your style they have two other options. The eggplant was wonderful. No heavy breading. Large portion. Garlic rolls are very good. Side salads are very k look are and good. Order dressing on side. Balsamic is very tart and heavy. Tiramisu some if the best ever.,39 contributions,0.9456,0.201,0.773,0.025,Positive,Sept 2023,Couples
Love the pizza!,Aug 2023 • Family,"We were on vacation in Marco, and decided on staying in for dinner, and pizza sounded great. If you go to their website, it said that they weren't taking online orders, so we were confused whether or not we could order carry out. We gave them a call, and they clarified that they would take phone orders, they just weren't doing online orders. We ordered a large pepperoni, pizza, and an order of the garlic knots. Pizza was delicious! We are normally thin crust fans, but went with the regular hand tossed style, and enjoyed it very much. The garlic knots had mixed reviews. They were definitely buttery and garlicky, but were very thick and doughy. Personally, it was a little overwhelming to me, and I wasn't a big fan, but the rest of the group enjoyed them. We will definitely order Joeys again!",805 contributions,0.9737,0.161,0.812,0.026,Positive,Aug 2023,Family
Joey’s way is the way,Jun 2023 • Family,"This is always in our rotation when we stay on Marco. The day we arrive we get it to-go and on our last night we eat at the restaurant. And if we stay long enough we get it in the idle of the trip as well. The Joeys way crust, which is thin and cut in squares, is the closest thing to Chicago tavern style that I’ve found on the island. We get pepperoni instead of sausage but I’ve had the sausage it definitely reminds me of the sausage I’d get in Chicago. I have noticed the prices have gone up significantly but that is just reality these days. I think a large thin crust pep is like $25 or $28. I’m addition to the pizza my wife is a big fan of the Caesar salad, really likes the dressing. Will typically get an extra one for the next day. I also like their take on key lime pie, a bit richer with some white chocolate mixed so not traditional but still good. It’s worth noting that when we went in mid June for an early dinner around 6, it’s pretty hot out and the sun is shining it does get pretty warm inside the restaurant. Like warm enough that you don’t want to hang around any longer than you have to. My wife actually said she was sweating. There is a lot of movement through the doors with the tables outside and people coming and going through the front door.",1360 contributions,0.9927,0.171,0.823,0.006,Positive,Jun 2023,Family

Cardboard Pizza,May 2023 • None,"This had to be the worst pizza I ever ate in my life. If you like cardboard then you'll love the Pizza, but if your looking for good pizza, I recommend you pass this place by. Garlic knots were horrible and mozzarella sticks pretty bad too.

Worst pizza we’ve even eaten in our lives,Apr 2023 • None,"This had to be the most god awful pizza our family of four has ever eaten. We ordered a large New York style pizza and also a large Sicilian pizza with ham and chicken. Bill was $72 for TAKE OUT! Get the pizzas back to our condo and as soon as we opened the box, they didn’t look great. We all agreed they were both terrible. Completely flavorless! Cheese had no flavor, sauce had no flavor and crust was truly the worst we have ever had (both the New York style and the Sicilian style). DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY GETTING PIZZA FROM HERE.

Won’t be back,Apr 2023 • Family,"We had been to Joey’s in the past and enjoyed it. My daughter and our grandchildren were visiting and we thought that this would be a good place for dinner. I ordered the traditional pizza with meatballs. The crust was not crisp, the meatballs were little cubes that were as hard as hockey pucks. My grandson ordered linguine and meatballs. The meatballs were a disturbing dark brown and were dry with no flavor. The other entrees were just average…calzone, stuffed eggplant. The server was very good and attentive. The straw that broke the camels back was in the restroom. As I was washing my hands, one of the kitchen staff emerged from a stall and left the restroom without washing his hands. This completely turned me off. Also, no sign in the restroom for employees to wash their hands before returning to work. Having worked in the restaurant industry as an owner, this is a training issue. Very disappointing. We will not be back.",,-0.7264,0.052,0.849,0.099,Negative,Apr 2023,Family

We could not have picked a more perfect first experience. The awesome staff could not get enough of our very excited puppy Peach. They were so welcoming ! We weren't there 10 minutes when the manager came running over with a bowl of ice-water. He & all the servers loved over our Peach. It made me feel so totally relaxed after being very apprehensive. DID I MENTION HOW GREAT THE FOOD WAS ?! We have gone there in the past many times; simply can not go wrong. And now seeing how my Peach was welcomed, we will certainly be going more often.

Popular Pizza/Pasta Spot,Mar 2023 • None,"A very casual indoor/outdoor spot on Collier Ave on Marco Island. Considering how crazy busy things are ""in season"" here, the service was OK. Food was pretty good, and the servings were huge...most of our group left with a box. One of the minor complaints is that because we had four couples, we asked if they would take our orders ""boy, girl""...""we don't do that"". Not a deal breaker, but when you're not prepared for that, we're all trying to break large bills so we can at least divvy up the total 4 ways.

Great for Take Out,Nov 2022 • Family,"We ordered the deep dish and the regular (thin) crust - both were great! We got the largest size and they were plenty big to feed hungry, tired beach folks. Heavy toppings and sauce - very tasty and piping hot! Meatballs were good as well - about the size of a golfball, so 3 to an order was not really enough to share. The tiramisu and spumoni are not to be missed - wowza! It took about 45 mins to pick up after placing the order - definitely plan give yourself time to deal with the hassle of parking.

Next up I ordered theCold Broccoli Salad with a light lemon vinaigrette and Kalimantan olives with red peppers. Excellent and a meal of itself. Entrees were the Chicken Caruso in a wonderful broth and sautéed spinach and the Chicken Limone with linguine. The chicken in each was tender enough to be cut with a fork, linguine cooked to perfection, Al dente. A wonderful meal all around.

Always great! Consistent - very good service and food,Nov 2021 • Family,"Dined here on two separate occasions last week during a stay in Marco Island. First visit since pre-Covid and Joeys never disappoints! The garlic knots and Caesar salad are fantastic as are the multitude of entrées that please all palates. Have not tried the pizza but stick with veal, chicken and pastas. Lovely outdoor patio. Indoor dining does not seem very distanced. Although the restaurant is popular and very busy, wait times are minimal due to the sheer size. The only thing I would fault is the fact that the entrées are brought out while still eating salads or appetizers. This is a bit frustrating.

I will probably try something else, but not the pizza, haha! Give a shot and see what you think... the reviews are kind of mixed, so it may just be a preference!

We were staying in a high rise condo gated community with a guard house, and it was a bit of a hassle to get the delivery coordinated (with the condo not Joey’s), but this hit the spot. Pizza was a smidge “bland”. Could have used some red pepper flakes maybe, we even tried salt. So it wasn’t the best pizza ever but it was good enough.

While the ingredients were the familiar breadcrumbs and olive oil some how it was more liquid than stuffing. I also order stuffed clams....again this liquidish sauce all over the plate.

Called next day and asked for Joey — I don’t want anything but thought he should know what’s going on with orders and staff.

T00 much garlic,Nov 2019 • None,"Very noisy when we arrived but seated easily. Garlic knots were undercooked / or cooked too quickly as the middles were not cooked properly. Too much garlic salt and Parmesan on them. I don’t think there was any fresh garlic in or on them, perhaps Joey can verify. Our party ordered 3 Veal Caruso’s. I had looked at the veal dinners on line before going and the one picture showing veal has a small portion of linguine on the plate. I wrongly assumed that the meal came with the pasta. There is only one veal meal that comes with pasta and that is penne. When it did arrive the spinach which ‘in my opinion’ had WAY TOO MUCH GARLIC on it was half over the veal thereby making the breadcrumbed topping, soggy. Because of the over use of garlic, the flavour of the spinach was not allowed to be tasted. Again, in my opinion, the spinach had not been drained enough, it may have been the sauce, but was either a very thin sauce, or too much water left in the spinach. Overall, not impressed, which why I rated it a 3. Won’t be rushing back, sorry.",5 contributions,0.7898,0.061,0.907,0.031,Positive,Nov 2019,None

I double checked my online order to make sure the mistake was not mine. It wasn't. The large pie, with 4 toppings, delivery and tip set us back $32, which for Marco is not too bad. The sauce on the pizza was a bit acidic and not to our liking. The crust was weird in that it was more like a cracker crust, not a raised dough crust. A bit chewy and dry on the edges. I like the pizza edges, but this one didn't work for me. Cheese was good as was the pepperoni and black olives.

Pizza can be ordered as a thin, very thin or deep pan with a selection of speciality ingredients or you can make your own with various toppings. A large pizza easily feeds two people and if you are having starters and side dishes then small pizza may also feed two people. Pizza tasted great and if you like to dip your crust then ask for ranch dip when ordering. They do great desserts too so leave enough room for them!

The strong smell arrived at the table as the plates approached and nearly knocked us over before the food was set down.

He wouldn’t listen and decided to just speak over us while asking him to explain how a simple dish containing no meat and just a simple vegetable could cost more than other dishes that some of our party had chosen.
